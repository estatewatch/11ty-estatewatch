Circa 200 homes in two towers on the Montague road estate have been earmarked for redevelopment.

The estate was initially one of 11 estates [identified](https://democracy.walthamforest.gov.uk/documents/s10654/4.2.%20LSP%20report%20-%20Estates%20Review.pdf) for possible redevelopment in a 2010 Estates Capacity Study.

In 2018 it was decided to refurbish instead of redevelop the two tower blocks, but the botched commencement of refurbishment works has led the Council to re-consider demolition.

Its latest proposals claimed that continuing refurbishment would cost £35-42m, while redevelopment would cost £250m.

The new redevelopment option would involve building “ circa 450-500 new homes” which would be “all affordable”, split 50:50 between social rent and shared ownership.

However, the plans identify a budget “gap” of £110m.
