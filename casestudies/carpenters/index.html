      <h1>Carpenters estate, Newham</h1>
        <p>The Carpenters Estate is near to the Queen Elizabeth (Olympic) Park, Stratford, in the London Borough of Newham.  The estate was completed in 1970, providing 710 homes.  Plans for its regeneration have been under consideration since 2000, with several buildings earmarked for demolition and the decanting of residents having started in 2005/06.  Three tower blocks on the estate have been emptied of council tenants, though some leaseholders remain.  The lower rise buildings continue to be occupied by a mixed community of council tenants, leaseholders and freeholders and this remains a strong and supportive community.</p>
<p>To save the estate from demolition, <a href="https://savecarpenters.wordpress.com/about/">Carpenters Against Regeneration Plans (CARP)</a> was formed by residents of the estate in 2011.  <a href="/images/ccplan.pdf">Carpenters Community Plan</a> was published in 2013 and the <a href="https://greatercarpenterscouk.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/np-june-2019-submission-version.pdf">Greater Carpenters Neighbourhood Plan</a> in 2019, both of which propose a bottom-up community based approach to planning the future of the estate.</p>

</center>
<p>Newham Council is carrying out an options appraisal with residents on the estate, each option involving a varying degree of demolition.  A ballot is due to be held some time in 2020.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/-/media/lldc/local-plan/examination-2019/inspectors-reports/appendix-1_inspectors-lldc-revised-lp_final-report.ashx?la=en">Planning Inspector’s report</a> on the Local Plan (London Legacy Development Corporation) published in April 2020 found against the demolition of the Carpenters estate and said:
<i><strong>
“Although the formal residents ballot is yet to take place, it is highly likely from all the written representations and spoken contributions at the hearing sessions, that most residents in the Greater Carpenters area are expressing the wish to remain where they live now and would resist comprehensive redevelopment and the inevitable disruption and community displacement....”
</strong></i></p>
<p>More information on the Carpenters Community Plan can be found in <a href="https://justspace.org.uk/2014/06/19/staying-put-an-anti-gentrification-handbook-for-council-estates-in-london/">Staying Put: An Anti-Gentrification Handbook for Council Estates in London</a>, produced by The London Tenants Federation, Professor Loretta Lees, Just Space, and SNAG.</p>
<div class="card-body">
<p class="lead">Key themes discussed in the interviews:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>The estate’s residents describe its regeneration as having gone on for a long time with very little resolve in sight.</li>
		<li>Residents have been moved out and several buildings remain empty, creating a ‘ghost town’ and a feeling that the estate has been intentionally depopulated and degenerated to favour redevelopment.</li>
		<li>Whilst some residents have moved away, there has been a long term resistance to the estate’s regeneration. Keeping the community together is an important priority.</li>
		<li>The area is experiencing social change, the new-build homes that border the estate, in particular, are described as being for ‘foreign’ investors and outsiders, not locals.</li>
		<li>The Olympic Games and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Westfield shopping centre, Stratford International and other train links, are all seen to be adding to gentrification pressures on the estate.</li></ul>
